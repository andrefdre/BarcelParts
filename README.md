<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction

<p>This projected started in the beggining of my university and I setup myself to build an autonumous car that could drive alone. </p>
<p>The main objective was to make the car and add GPS navigation so it could have coordinates previously set up and then run that course. </p>
<p>So it all started with the mechanical part of the project with the palns to be 4 wheel drive and have a better suspension than the previous version. The components were mostly 3D printed and only the shafts and some other parts where bought. </p>
<p>After that, started the developemnt of the eletrical componnets alongside the programming of the code. This part was the most difficult since I had lots of problems with the communication beetwen the car and the controller.  </p>
<p>The previous version used bluetoth chips but since the range was very limited i eventualy changed to RF24 chips wich use radio waves that has more range.  </p>
